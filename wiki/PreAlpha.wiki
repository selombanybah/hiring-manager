= Introduction =

I am not getting enough time to complete this project.  I have uploaded the code in the hope that someone may find it useful/ interesting and may contribute code/fund.


= Details =

To run the current codebase.

1) checkout the code

2) Yii framework is included in the code so you need not do anything.

3) create a mysql database with the dump at rootfolder/rct_july_30.sql.gz

Any issues, get in touch
